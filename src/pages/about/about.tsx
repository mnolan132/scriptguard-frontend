      <Text>
        Welcome to ScriptGuard â€” a growing library of components and utilities
        designed to help developers lock down their sites, protect their users
        and assets, and give end-users better control over their own security.

        I'm Matthew, a software developer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software
        Engineering and industry-recognized certifications in Cybersecurity. I
        love combining my skills in development with my passion for security to
        build tools that empower developers to take charge of their security
        posture.

        While ScriptGuard isnâ€™t a silver bullet, itâ€™s a step in the right
        direction. It helps developers follow better security practices and
        gives users a seamless experience where security doesnâ€™t feel like a
        chore. Most importantly, ScriptGuard sparks conversations about security
        â€” something that can drive greater awareness and skill-building in the
        developer community.

        Currently, ScriptGuard is built for React, but as an open-source
        project, itâ€™s designed to be adaptable â€” reverse-engineerable for other
        frameworks, with a component catalog that's constantly expanding.
